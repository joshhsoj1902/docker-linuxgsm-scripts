# Gmod

This folder contains the basic building blocks for a custom gmod server.

## Basic usage

```shell
docker compose up
```

## Notes

- Networking with Gmod can be a bit wonky, Connecting to the server via the computers IP or your external IP usually works best (not localhost).
- Fastdl doesn't seem to work on linux clients.
